Macro to move messages to a different Outlook folder

Be sure to edit the target folder name in (must exist already).

MoveToSecond can be called as a macro when in Inbox/folder view and will move the selected messages to the target folder.
MoveToSecondMsg will do similar when in message view.  Both can be assigned to a button and added to the toolbar.
